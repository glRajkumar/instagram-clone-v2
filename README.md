## Updates
Fully Changed and Optimized comparing to the previous version. Also added more features.

## To hide credentials
Add .env file outside of server.
{
 "MONGODB_URI",
 "jwtSecretKey",
 "EMAIL",
 "PASS"
}

## Testing 
For backend testing, I used REST Client(VS Code Ext.). All files are seperated in the test folder.

## Hashing password
I used bcryptjs package. If you need bcrypt, just changed it.  

### Dropped Folder
Dropped folders in client and server are just for my reference only. 
It doesn't have meaning for you, so delete it.
